## Summary
Implemented a concurrent, transactional wallet-to-wallet transfer service in Go backed by PostgreSQL. The service supports atomic balance movement, double-entry ledger bookkeeping, deterministic deadlock prevention, and exact-once execution semantics via lease-managed idempotency records. It follows a clean layered architecture (handler -> service -> repository -> model), backed by an automated integration test suite and an end-to-end shell test suite.

   * Environment & edge-case debugging: Resolved Windows Git Bash newline artifacts (CRLF to LF), fixed validation tags for wallet identifiers (underscores only), and added mathematical overflow guards on currency conversions.
   * code review
   

## Schema Design
Defined in: migrations/1_init_schema.setup.sql

### Tables
* wallets: Stores account state (id, balance, status, created_at, updated_at). Balances are stored as 64-bit integers (BIGINT) representing minor units (cents) to eliminate floating-point drift.
* transfers: Stores money movement records (id, from_wallet_id, to_wallet_id, amount, status, idempotency_key, created_at).
* ledger_entries: Immutable general ledger capturing every debit and credit event (id, wallet_id, transfer_id, type, amount, balance_before, balance_after, created_at).
* idempotency_records: Manages execution locks and cached responses (idempotency_key, payload_hash, status, response_code, response_body, locked_until, created_at).

### Constraints & Invariants
* Non-Negative Balance: CHECK (balance >= 0) on wallets guarantees that balance overdrafts are impossible at the database engine level.
* Positive Transfer Amounts: CHECK (amount > 0) on transfers and ledger_entries.
* Double-Entry Symmetry: Unique constraint uq_transfer_wallet_type (transfer_id, wallet_id, type) on ledger_entries ensures a transfer cannot double-debit or double-credit the same wallet.
* Referential Integrity: Foreign keys from transfers and ledger_entries to wallets(id).

### Indexes
* wallets(id): Primary key index for O(1) row lookups and locks.
* ledger_entries(wallet_id, created_at DESC): Composite index optimized for rapid wallet statement generation and audit history scans.
* idempotency_records(idempotency_key): Primary key index for instant lease checks and replay lookups.

## Idempotency Strategy
* Payload Hashing: On every transfer request, the service normalizes the incoming payload and computes its SHA-256 hash.
* Lease Acquisition: The service inserts a lease record into idempotency_records with an expiration window (locked_until).
* First Request: Lease is acquired; the transfer executes atomically within a database transaction. Upon commit, the final HTTP status code and response payload are persisted, and the status transitions to COMPLETED.
* Identical Replay: If an incoming request matches an existing COMPLETED key and has the identical payload hash, the transaction is bypassed and the cached response body and HTTP status code are served immediately.
* Tamper Protection: If a request reuses an existing idempotency_key but the SHA-256 payload hash differs, execution is immediately aborted with 400 Bad Request (idempotency key already used with different payload).
* In-Flight Conflict: If a duplicate arrives while a request is actively processing (locked_until > now()), the system rejects concurrent mutation to prevent race conditions.

Explain how duplicate requests are handled safely.
Payload Fingerprinting: The incoming request body is normalized, and its SHA-256 hash is computed and stored alongside the user-supplied idempotencyKey.

Atomic Lease Lock: Before moving funds, the system attempts to insert a record into idempotency_records with a leased status and an active expiration (locked_until = now() + TTL).

Safe Replay Without Re-Execution: If an incoming request matches an existing COMPLETED record with an identical SHA-256 payload hash, the business logic and money movement are completely bypassed. The service immediately serves the cached HTTP status code and response payload.

Tamper Detection: If an existing idempotencyKey is reused with altered parameters (e.g., a changed amount or recipient), the SHA-256 hashes will mismatch. The system halts immediately with 400 Bad Request ("idempotency key already used with different payload").

In-Flight Conflict Suppression: If a duplicate request arrives while the original operation is still processing within its lease window (locked_until > now()), the system rejects the second execution, preventing concurrent duplicate ledger side-effects.

## Concurrency Strategy
* Pessimistic Row-Level Locking: Balances are modified within a PostgreSQL transaction using SELECT balance, status FROM wallets WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE.
* Deterministic Lock Ordering: To eliminate SQL deadlocks when opposite transfers occur concurrently (e.g., Alice -> Bob while Bob -> Alice), row locks are always acquired in alphabetical order:
  firstID, secondID := fromID, toID
  if firstID > secondID {
      firstID, secondID = toID, fromID
  }
  // Lock firstID, then lock secondID
  This eliminates circular wait conditions, mathematically guaranteeing zero deadlocks across high-concurrency transfers.
* Double-Spending Prevention: Database row-level locks serialize balance reads and mutations for any given wallet. Combined with the engine-level CHECK (balance >= 0) constraint, no balance can be debited beyond its available funds.
* High-Concurrency Verification: Verified via TestTransfer_HighConcurrencyNoDoubleSpend, where 10 concurrent goroutines attempt to spend from a shared balance simultaneously (100 initial balance, 10 transfers of 15). Exactly 6 succeed (90 spent) and 4 fail with insufficient balance, preserving the exact final database invariants.

Explain how you prevent race conditions and double spending.
Pessimistic Row-Level Locking (FOR UPDATE): Before checking balances or applying debits/credits, the transaction locks both participating wallet records via SELECT balance, status FROM wallets WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE. This ensures only one transfer can read and mutate a wallet's balance at any given moment; subsequent parallel attempts must wait until the active transaction commits or rolls back.
Deterministic Lexicographical Lock Ordering: To prevent deadlocks when opposing transfers occur concurrently (e.g., Alice transferring to Bob while Bob transfers to Alice), wallets are locked in strict alphabetical order

## How to Run
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running and initialize the database:
   createdb walletDB
   psql -d walletDB -f migrations/1_init_schema.setup.sql
2. Start the API server:
   export DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/walletDB?sslmode=disable"
   export PORT=8080
   go run cmd/api/main.go

## How to Test
* Integration Tests: Runs the suite covering transfer execution, idempotency replays, payload tamper detection, insufficient balances, and concurrent race conditions:
  env:TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/walletDB_test?sslmode=disable"; go test -v ./tests/...
* End-to-End Suite: Runs client-side verification with formatted JSON assertions against a live server:
  chmod +x scripts/test_e2e.sh
  ./scripts/test_e2e.sh

## Tradeoffs / Assumptions
* Stored Balances vs. Pure Event-Sourced Ledger: Rather than recalculating balances by aggregating all historic ledger rows on every read (O(N) query cost), we store an explicit balance column on wallets and mutate it atomically alongside ledger_entries. This provides O(1) balance reads and row locks while preserving complete double-entry auditability.
* Minor-Unit Arithmetic & Overflow Boundary: All monetary values are parsed into 64-bit signed integers (int64 cents) to avoid IEEE-754 floating-point inaccuracies. Inputs are capped at (math.MaxInt64 - 99) / 100 to prevent integer multiplication overflow.
* Identifier Formatting: Wallet IDs enforce an alphanumeric and underscore character set (^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+) via custom Gin binding validators; hyphens are disallowed.
* Local Test Infrastructure: Tests run against a live PostgreSQL instance rather than an in-memory SQL mock to validate row-level locking semantics (FOR UPDATE), isolation boundaries, and check constraints directly.
